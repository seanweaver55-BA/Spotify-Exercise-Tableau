# Music Genre Analysis Dashboard – Tableau Project

Welcome to my Tableau Public project where I explore patterns in musical features across genres using Spotify track data. This project highlights my ability to create insightful visualisations and perform feature-based comparisons, uncovering how mood, loudness, liveness, and duration relate to popularity across genres.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains detailed audio attributes for tracks available on Spotify, including:

| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| genre             | The genre the track belongs to |
| artist_name       | Artist(s) who performed the track |
| track_name        | Name of the track |
| popularity        | Popularity score (0–100), based on play frequency |
| duration_ms       | Track length in milliseconds |
| energy            | Intensity and activity level (0.0–1.0) |
| danceability      | Suitability for dancing (0.0–1.0) |
| valence           | Positivity or emotional tone (0.0–1.0) |
| loudness          | Overall track loudness (dB) |
| liveness          | Probability of live audience presence |
| acousticness      | Likelihood the track is acoustic |
| speechiness       | Amount of spoken content |
| tempo             | Tempo in beats per minute (BPM) |

## 📌 Insights Visualised

### 1. Mood Grouping of Genres
A calculated field combines **Energy, Danceability, and Valence** into a single “Mood Group” score, representing the overall levity of a track.  
- Genres such as **Reggaeton, Reggae, and Ska** scored the highest.  
- **Soundtrack, Opera, and Classical** scored lowest by a large margin.

### 2. Liveness vs Loudness
Scatter plot comparing track *Liveness* and *Loudness*.  
- Most tracks cluster between **–12 dB and –6 dB** loudness, and liveness between **0.15 and 0.25**.  
- Suggests loudness does **not strongly correlate** with liveness.

### 3. Average Valence by Genre
Comparison of valence scores across genres, highlighting emotional tone.  
- Genres like **Reggae, Children’s Music, and Ska** exhibit higher positivity.  
- **Opera, Classical, and Soundtrack** genres sit at the lower end of the spectrum.

### 4. Track Duration vs Popularity
Duration was standardised into minutes (`duration_ms / 60`) for easier interpretation.  
- **Pop and Dance** genres show higher popularity regardless of track length.  
- **Electronic and Jazz** sustain popularity with longer average durations.
